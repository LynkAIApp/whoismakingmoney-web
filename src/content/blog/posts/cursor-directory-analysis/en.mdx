<div className="summary">

📊 **Summary**

**Let's talk money first**: cursor.directory, a website built by developers Pontis and Victor in just **3 hours**, currently generates **$34,000** in monthly revenue with a **99.8%** profit margin.

**Core Product**: It started as an extremely simple Cursor AI rules directory, but behind it lies a profound story about the perfect combination of product definition and marketing.

**"Secret Weapon"**: This is not a "technical miracle," but a perfect storm created by **"Timing," "Design," and "Lightning Execution."** It proves that in the AI era, development is just the implementation path, while precise product definition (what to build) and exceptional marketing (how to ignite) are the real engines that determine success or failure.

## Chapter 1: Product Definition - Discovering Gold in the "Pain Point Vacuum"

"I was shocked—why hasn't anyone done this?" - Pontis

The starting point of cursor.directory wasn't a complex business plan, but a "eureka moment" struck at 30,000 feet on a flight. Founder Pontis discovered a **"pain point vacuum"**:

**Phenomenon**: All top developers are flocking to Cursor, the revolutionary AI code editor.

**Need**: Everyone desperately needs high-quality "Rules" to improve efficiency.

**Vacuum**: Google search results are chaotic, forum answers are fragmented—there's simply no centralized, high-quality rules directory.

This is the golden moment of product definition—a strong growth wave (Wave) accompanied by an unmet core need.

Pontis and Victor didn't try to invent a more complex AI. They chose to solve this most basic, most urgent **"Discoverability"** problem. What they wanted to do was draw the first, clearest map on this new continent.

## Chapter 2: Design - The Ultimate Moat in 2025

"In a world where AI can generate websites in 10 minutes, design is your only moat." - Pontis

When generating a website with AI in 10 minutes has become the norm, 99% of products fall into the trap of "ugly uniformity." cursor.directory stands out with its extremely clean, meticulously detailed design.

This is not accidental, but strategic:

**Professionalism**: Co-founder Victor is a designer himself, and they have a reusable design system.

**Strategic Awareness**: They deeply understand that in an era of functional convergence, exceptional design itself is the most powerful marketing weapon. A beautifully designed product makes users want to share and talk about it.

**Design is not a cost, it's propagation power.** The success of cursor.directory is first a victory of product definition: solving a real pain point in a delightful way at the right time.

## Chapter 3: Marketing - A Zero-Cost Viral Blitzkrieg

A good product is worth zero if no one knows about it. cursor.directory's marketing strategy is a perfect template for indie developers because it didn't spend a single dollar on advertising.

### Engine One: Lightning Execution and the "3 Hours" Story

"We just launched first, then kept iterating."

Behind Pontis and Victor's ability to launch in 3 hours are three key elements:

**Rejecting Perfectionism**: They used a handwritten JSON file as the initial database and deployed in half an hour. Done is better than perfect—this principle allowed them to capture a fleeting time window.

**Tool Compound Interest**: They used their most familiar, muscle-memory-level tech stack (Next.js, Vercel, Shadcn), focusing all energy on "implementation" rather than "learning."

**DNA-Level Synergy**: One designer, one developer, years of collaboration experience enabled seamless coordination.

The "3-hour launch" story itself became explosive marketing content. It's simple enough, counterintuitive enough, and inspiring enough to make everyone who hears it want to check it out.

### Engine Two: Community Ignition and Word-of-Mouth Spread

After the website launched, they ignited a perfect viral cycle:

**Posting on X (Twitter)**: Pontis has long practiced "Build in Public," already accumulating trust and audience in the developer community. His first post received millions of views, bringing the first wave of core traffic to the website.

**Hacker News Front Page**: The product precisely hit developers' pain points and quickly reached the front page of this world's top developer community, triggering viral spread.

**YouTube Creators Spontaneously Covering**: Because the product solves real pain points, has eye-catching design, and the story itself is highly inspiring, numerous tech creators spontaneously made videos about it, bringing sustained, massive organic traffic.

cursor.directory's growth is a textbook example of organic growth driven by both the product's inherent value and an engaging story.

## Chapter 4: Business Model - Evolution from Community Product to "Money Printer"

cursor.directory's business model is an elegant evolution from 0 to 1, then from 1 to N.

### Revenue Sources "Three-Stage Rocket":

**Recruiting Ads**: Packaging the website's precise developer "attention" and selling it to recruiting companies that need it most. This is the first stable, low-friction cash flow.

**MCP Directory Featured Listings**: When the website becomes an industry "standard," it gains platform "rent-seeking" ability. Having developers pay for more exposure is the second growth engine.

**Custom Rules Generator (SaaS Tool)**: Evolving from a content platform to a SaaS tool. Generating custom rules for users' projects through AI is an ultimate monetization model with high technical barriers and high profit margins.

### Financial Data Perspective:

- **Monthly Revenue**: $34,000
- **Monthly Cost**: $500
- **Profit Margin**: 99.8%
- **Annualized Revenue**: $408,000
- **Hourly Return**: $11,333/hour

Behind these numbers is the ultimate form of a side project—a high-profit, low-maintenance, fully automated money-making machine.

## Chapter 5: The Ultimate Lesson for Builders: Just Fucking Start

"When you start building, when you commit to something, you'll eventually get into the flow. One thing leads to another. There's no such thing as failure." - Pontis

The story of cursor.directory ultimately returns to the simplest and most profound truth. Most of us don't lack good ideas—we lack the courage and action to immediately call a friend and say **"we need to do this"** the moment we see an opportunity.

### Success Elements You Can Replicate:

**Timing > Everything**: Continuously observe your field, looking for that "pain point vacuum" that's rising but lacks supporting infrastructure (like directories, tools, communities).

**Design is Your Moat**: In an era where AI makes functional implementation cheap, invest time and energy in polishing your product's design and experience—it will bring you disproportionate returns.

**Speed is Everything**: Use your most familiar tools, launch a 60-point product first, then quickly iterate to 90 points. Don't let "perfectionism" kill your project.

**Build in Public**: Starting today, share your thoughts, learning, and building process on social media. Your audience isn't built in a day—it's accumulated through consistent sharing.

The difference between us and Pontis isn't talent—it's whether we start.

How many "someday/maybe" projects are lying in your Notion?

What if, this weekend, you spend 3 hours building it and launching it?

After all, the worst-case scenario is just learning something.
